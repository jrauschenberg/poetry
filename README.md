# Poetaster

Poetaster analyzes any poem (or text) you enter for sentiment and word patterns. It also compares it to some of the greats to see whose poetry it is closest to, using data visualization. It was inspired by David Yang and Nimit Maru's Programming Valentine's Day Poetry, and takes advantage of Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
